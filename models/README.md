# Modeling

We provide an example demonstrating how to integrate the `PoolSkip` module into a model.
If you'd like to use a different base model, please download it from [weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100](https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100).

In this folder:

* `resnet.py` contains the original ResNet model.

* `resnet_poolskip.py` contains the modified version with the PoolSkip module integrated.
